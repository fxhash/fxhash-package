# @fxhash/react

@fxhash/react is a TypeScript package designed to simplify blockchain interactions and provide utility hooks for React applications. It acts as an intermediary layer between the @fxhash/contracts-{blockchains} packages, allowing you to interact with the various blockchains contracts in a consistent manner.

Due to the lack of react tooling around Taquito, it also provides a set of hooks to simplify the process of interacting with the Tezos blockchain.

This is a [Vocs](https://vocs.dev) project bootstrapped with the Vocs CLI.

- packages must have a `/doc` folder in which their documentation is located
- the `/doc` folder must contain a `README.md` file, which will be the root page of the package in the documentation

## Documenting a package

Package documentation must oblige certain rules designed to:

- **Have the documentation readeable from Github**: when navigating to a package `/doc` folder, users should be able to navigate the documentation easily without having to rely on the documentation website to be on
- **Comply to the main documentation auto-generation rules**: the main documentation (this application) automatically generates package documentation so that every package is features on the main documentation; such process relies on **following strict rules** which are listed below

# Use-cases

These use-cases demonstrate how the fxhash SDK can be used in specific contexts. It should be known the SDK isn't limited to such cases, however they happened to be real occurences which have been built in the past; as such they offer a good starting point for many cases, maybe including yours. It's also a good way to understand how the SDK is actually being used for different purposes to get familiar with its concepts.

- [**Project showcase**](./project-showcase.md): showcase a project on your website using the fxhash API, so that it's always up-to-date with most recent data
- [**Customized minting page**](./customized-minting-page.md): build unique (or simple!) minting experiences on your own website, natively leveraging the various options we also provide on the main fxhash platform
- [**Scrap data**](./scrap-data.md): fetch the data of projects for your own cases—this can be useful if you want to fetch the minted iterations of you projects, your collectors, etc...
- [**Nodejs minter**](./nodejs-minter.md): automate the minting of a project using a nodejs application—this can be useful if your project has certain requirements where you need the control from a backend service to orchestrate the minting
